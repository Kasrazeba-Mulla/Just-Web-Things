This is a simple Restruant Menu website built using HTML and CSS. There is a main dic element further divied into 3 sections for Starters, Main Course and Desserts.Each of these sections has an img ,heading and basic info and a button created using anchor tag .I have used flexbox for making the website responsive .The mobile viewport (below 900px) has a column based layout , and above 900px , a row based layout is used.Also the button has transition when it is hovered or focused.
